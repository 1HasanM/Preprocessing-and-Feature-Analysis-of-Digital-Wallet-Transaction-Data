In this project, digital wallet transaction data was preprocessed, converting categorical variables into numerical format and identifying key features affecting transaction status. Categorical data such as product category, payment method, device type, and transaction location were transformed using one-hot encoding, while transaction status was numerically encoded. Using these preprocessed data, a Random Forest classifier was applied to determine the most important features influencing transaction outcomes and to evaluate model performance. The main goal of the project is to understand digital wallet transactions, improve data quality, and uncover critical factors that impact transaction status.
